Star Trek Trivia Game

This is the ReadMe file for my “History of the Federation” Trivia Game.  It was the assignment for the 5th week at Web Developer Bootcamp.  

The idea was to make a timed trivia game using JavaScript and Jquery which present the player with 4 possible choices for each question.  I chose a Star Trek as the theme as I felt things would be more interesting if the player could imagine that they were trying to graduate from Starfleet Academy.   

The game has built in instructions and is designed to be very simple for the player to play.  I made sure to include at least one question from each series and each era of the film franchise. I aimed to make it an interesting and challenging game from the point of view of someone who has seen most Star Trek stories once. Die-hard fans will find most of it easy but causal fans should find it enjoyable.  

I added several sound effects [including a warning tone would signal when time was almost out] and some pictures and gifs.  

To play simply load the html file on your browser of choice.  Here’s the link...
